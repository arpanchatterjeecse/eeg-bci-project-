## üìå Overview  
This project implements a **Brain‚ÄìComputer Interface (BCI)** model for **seizure detection and prediction** from EEG signals. Leveraging a **Bidirectional GRU with Temporal Attention**, the architecture captures both sequential dependencies and salient temporal features in brainwave patterns.  

The goal is to provide a **robust, accurate, and explainable AI framework** for healthcare applications, particularly in **epileptic seizure monitoring and prediction**.

## üèóÔ∏è Model Architecture  
- **Input**: EEG sequences (178 time steps, 1 channel)  
- **Layers**:  
  - Bidirectional GRU (2 stacked layers)  
  - Dropout + Batch Normalization  
  - Temporal Attention Mechanism (focus on critical EEG segments)  
  - Dense (ReLU) + Dropout  
  - Sigmoid Output for Binary Classification  

```python
# Core Highlights
# - Bidirectional GRU layers for sequential EEG learning
# - Temporal Attention Mechanism for interpretability
# - Bayesian Optimization for hyperparameter tuning
# - Early Stopping to prevent overfitting
#
# These components collectively enhance the model's ability to accurately
# capture temporal dependencies in EEG signals while maintaining
# generalization and interpretability.

## üîÑ Data Augmentation Pipeline

The project includes a comprehensive **data augmentation pipeline** designed specifically for EEG time series data to enhance model performance and robustness [web:7][web:10]. The augmentation methods preserve the temporal and frequency characteristics of EEG signals while increasing dataset diversity.

### Augmentation Techniques

1. **Jitter (Noise Addition)**: Adds Gaussian noise to simulate electrode artifacts and environmental interference
2. **Scaling**: Applies random amplitude scaling to account for inter-subject variability
3. **Time Warping**: Non-linear temporal distortion using cubic spline interpolation to simulate natural EEG variations
