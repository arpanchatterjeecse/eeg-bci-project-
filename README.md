## üìå Overview  
This project implements a **Brain‚ÄìComputer Interface (BCI)** model for **seizure detection and prediction** from EEG signals. Leveraging a **Bidirectional GRU with Temporal Attention**, the architecture captures both sequential dependencies and salient temporal features in brainwave patterns.  

The goal is to provide a **robust, accurate, and explainable AI framework** for healthcare applications, particularly in **epileptic seizure monitoring and prediction**.

## üèóÔ∏è Model Architecture  
- **Input**: EEG sequences (178 time steps, 1 channel)  
- **Layers**:  
  - Bidirectional GRU (2 stacked layers)  
  - Dropout + Batch Normalization  
  - Temporal Attention Mechanism (focus on critical EEG segments)  
  - Dense (ReLU) + Dropout  
  - Sigmoid Output for Binary Classification  

```python
# Core Highlights
- Bidirectional GRU layers for sequential EEG learning  
- Temporal Attention Mechanism for interpretability  
- Bayesian Optimization for hyperparameter tuning  
- Early Stopping to prevent overfitting
